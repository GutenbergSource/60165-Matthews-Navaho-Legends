<HTML><BODY><p>An interesting an nicely illustrated study of the Navajo people.

<p>Navaho words in this book are transcribed using italic letters for letters that approximate
the sounds of those letters, as explained on page 55 in this book. This poses some challenges during the
formatting rounds (and PP), and it is for this reason I marked the book as hard. The easiest way is to get rid of the italics convention, and replace it with one that is easier to type. In this case, I've chosen to use the letter <b>x</b> for this. (Those who worked on projects with Esperanto should recognize this convention.)

<p>During the proofing-rounds, only in Navajo words, please use a following letter x to indicate
that the preceding letter is an italic letter. Thus, the name <b><i>H</i>a<i>t</i>á<i>l</i>i Pa<i>h</i>o<i>z</i>óni</b> should be typed as <code>Hxatxálxi Pahxozxóni</code>. In upper-case context, you can use an upper-case X: <b><i>D</i>OKOSLÍ<i>D</i></b> becomes <code>DXOKOSLÍDX</code>. The place name <b>Ds&#301;<i>ll</i>&#301;t<i>s</i>íbe<i>h</i>ogán</b> becomes <code>Ds[)i]lxlx[)i]tsxíbehxogán</code>. During the F-rounds, do not indicate the letters marked with x as italic.

<p>Please do suggest these ugly forms in P1 for word-check, so those can be verified. During PP, I will restore the italic forms.

<p>For the rest, you need to be alert for an a with a dot below (to be proofread as [a.]) and vowels with macrons and breves. Finally, please indicate the prime as ['], and the high turned comma (a reverse apostrophe) as `, to distinguish it from the apostrophe. Please alert me in the forums if other characters occur, that are not covered by the proofing instructions.

<p>Near the end of the Volume are a few pages with intralinear text. During the Formatting rounds, please handle these as the well-known song in the following example, such that the words that are aligned under each other are in group surrounded by brackets and separated by a standing bar: (during the P-rounds, please only concentrate on the correct words, no formatting please)
